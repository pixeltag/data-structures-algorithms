 - What makes an algorithm fast?
 - Way to estimate an algorithm works



 <h4>TIME COMPLEXITY</h4>
    - How many primitive operations are executed?


    COMPLEXITY    |   operations
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    O(1)          |   Running a statement, value look-up on an array, object, variable.
    O(logn)       |   Loops the cuts problem in half every iteration.
    O(n)          |   Looping through the values of an array.
    O(n^2)        |   Double nested loop.
    O(n^3)        |   Triple nested loop.



 <h4>SPACE COMPLEXITY</h4>
    - How much MEMORY is used? Space in MEMORY
